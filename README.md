👋 Hey, I’m Leo!

🖥️ Software developer in the making at Hive Helsinki.
💡 Learning by doing—mostly in C, C++, and whatever else gets the job done.
🔨 Built a Unix shell, a 3D game engine, an IRC server, and some zombies along the way.
🌍 Former restaurant manager, now serving up code instead of dinner.

Currently exploring backend development, system design, and cybersecurity. Always up for a challenge, breaking things (then fixing them), and learning something new.

🚀 Writing code, making mistakes, and learning from both.
